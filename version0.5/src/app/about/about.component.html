        <p>Here at EquHelp, we aim to create a digital environemnt for learning math and science.</p>
        <p> Anyone who has taken an online math or chemistry course has the felt the frustration of entering
            their anwsers or equations into a text box to recieve no real feedback.
        </p>
        <p> Alternativley, some course may require students to upload scratch work through pdfs, leaving TAs 
            with the chore of weeding through poor quility pdfs to attempt to assighn scores.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now imagine, a user interface that allows users to drag and drop their anwsers and equations into 
            place as intutively as they would on paper. Additionaly, this interface could export the equation
            and all the work that led up to that point to text, or save it as it appears didigtally.
